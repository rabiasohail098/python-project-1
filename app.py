## 🌱 What is a Growth Mindset?  
A **growth mindset** is the belief that intelligence, talents, and abilities **can be developed** through dedication, learning, and persistence.  
People with a growth mindset **embrace challenges, learn from failures, and continuously improve** their skills.  

On the other hand, a **fixed mindset** makes people believe that intelligence and talent are **static** – meaning, they can’t be changed.  

### 🔥 Why is a Growth Mindset Important?  
Having a growth mindset can transform your life. It helps you:  
✅ **Embrace challenges** instead of avoiding them  
✅ **Learn from criticism** rather than feeling discouraged  
✅ **Keep going despite failures** instead of giving up  
✅ **See effort as the key to success**  
✅ **Develop resilience** and overcome difficulties

## 🔄 **Fixed Mindset vs. Growth Mindset**  
Here’s a quick comparison to understand the difference:  

| 🔴 **Fixed Mindset**  | 🟢 **Growth Mindset**  |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| "I am either smart or not." | "I can get smarter by learning!" |
| "I avoid challenges." | "I love challenges!" |
| "I give up easily." | "I keep trying until I succeed!" |
| "Failure means I’m not good enough." | "Failure helps me improve!" |
| "Effort is useless if I’m not talented." | "Effort makes me stronger!" |
